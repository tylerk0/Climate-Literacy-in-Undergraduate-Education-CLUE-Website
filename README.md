# Climate Literacy in Undergraduate Education (CLUE) Website

## Description
We are developing a website for an ongoing project called Climate Literacy in Undergraduate Education (CLUE), which allows users to download worksheets and assessment prompts and access supplemental PowerPoints and videos regarding the geoscience project. Potential users are college professors, administrators, and institutional review boards. In general, users should be able to see an overview or summary of the CLUE project, view and download specific unit materials, and request access to download answers to individual worksheets.
