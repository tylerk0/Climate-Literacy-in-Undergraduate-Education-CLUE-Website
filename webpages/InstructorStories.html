						<strong>Nicole Davi:</strong> Hydrology and the Environment at William Paterson University of New Jersey. The module was implemented in a 400-level hydrology class that met for two and half hours each week. My class ran for 16 weeks and I started incorporating the module materials in the fourth week, after students were introduced to introductory material on watersheds, the hydrological cycle and ENSO. I used the activities from this module during the second half of the class, much like a lab. Students performed very well using these materials, and it was clear that they enjoyed working with it and were excited by it.

						<strong>Terri Plake:</strong> Hydrology: Sacred Waters at Northwest Indian College. The module was implemented in an introductory hydrology course that focuses on our local hydrologic systems with emphasis on salmonid habitat. This small course is designed for 300-level students majoring in Native Environmental Science and met for for 2-hour sessions twice a week. The module was piloted after the midterm, the 6th through 8th week of the quarter and provided an opportunity to build strong awareness about water sustainability through inquiry, statistics, and data.
